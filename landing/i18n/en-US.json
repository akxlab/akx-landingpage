        "cryptoquantum-more": "Crypto quantum is a new technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to improve the security of cryptocurrency transactions. Just like how a traditional lock can be opened with a key, current encryption methods can be cracked by hackers using advanced computer algorithms. But with crypto quantum, it's like the lock is on a rollercoaster and the key is a secret code that is only known by the sender and the receiver. It's much harder for hackers to figure out the code because it's based on the strange properties of quantum physics."
